autobw

Description
This small script detects the number of Windows (and Samba) computers on the LAN and adjusts the maximum upload / download bandwidth configured in deluge. The current host is excluded from the count.

Requirements
A recent version of deluge which includes deluge-console. It also needs smbtree (usually provided by the smbclient package in Debian/Ubuntu/etc.)

Usage
autobw is meant to be run from a relatively frequent cron job (mine is set for every 5 minutes) and you need to set the variables maxdownspeed, maxupspeed for the 'high' setting and regdownspeed, regupspeed for the 'low' one.

Limitations
Since it uses smbtree to detect other machines, it means smartphones and tables will not be detected (keep this in mind when determining your high setting) also, the Windows / Samba machine has to be visible on the network.
