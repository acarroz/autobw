autobw

Description
This small script detects the number of Windows (and Samba) computers on the LAN and adjusts the maximum upload / download bandwidth configured in deluge. The current host is excluded from the count.

Requirements
A recent version of deluge which includes deluge-console. It also needs smbtree (usually provided by the smbclient package in Debian/Ubuntu/etc.)

Usage
autobw is meant to be run from a relatively frequent cron job (mine is set for every 5 minutes) and you need to set the variables maxdownspeed, maxupspeed for the 'high' setting and regdownspeed, regupspeed for the 'Äºow' one.
